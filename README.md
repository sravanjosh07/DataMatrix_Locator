# DataMatrix_Locator 
DataMatrix code is a matrix 2D code ![IDAutomationStreamingDataMatrix aspx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45886202/137497976-29464e35-c7fc-47a3-b9c5-12f9aa1ecc9f.gif)
 that was developed by ID Matrix in 1987. It is made of black and white cells that are typically arranged in a pattern.The L-shape that follows its borders is its finder pattern, which is used by scanners to recognize and read the code.

#**Detecting the Datamatrix in an image**
Donghong proposed an algorithm based on Radon transform, which mainly locates data matrix code by the “L” finder pattern and dashed border detection.
